# UPE Website

## Description

This repository contains the source code for the website used by Boston University's chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE). It consists of two projects. The `/frontend/` directory contains the React user interface. The `/backend/` directory contains the Express REST API.

We use a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/0MtO7mPY/upe-website) to manage our roadmap. Reach out to Sai Nayunipati at [sain@bu.edu](mailto:sain@bu.edu) with questions or feature requests.
